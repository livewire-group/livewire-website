*Over 50% of Europe’s population ages 16–64 plays video games. The **total revenue for Europe's games industry was £23.3 billion** according to a report by the Interactive Software Federation of Europe and the European Games Developer Federation. The Middle East is the fastest growing online gaming population, with the mobile gaming segment alone projected to reach $4.4 billion by 2022, more than triple its growth from the $1.06 billion posted in 2016.*

Livewire’s expansion represents a key opportunity for brands who are understanding the importance of marketing to the gaming audience through a range of diverse opportunities, engaging a generation who is turning off traditional forms of media. Livewire is a trusted partner of brands, leading gaming strategy, ideation and activation of concepts across the evolving landscape of gaming marketing and gametech, with a focus on executing campaigns that deliver results.

Livewire’s launch will provide gaming marketing and gametech solutions to EMEA brands and clients through the company’s experience, partnerships and proprietary assets across research/insights, gaming strategy, esports, gaming talent, in and around game advertising, gaming audience solutions and direct publisher opportunities.

Livewire Co-Founders Indy Khabra and Brad Manuel commented: *“The opportunity and timing to launch Livewire EMEA with our first office in London allows us to bring our approach to clients in the region. Globally, gaming and esports is now a priority on the marketer’s agenda and brands are looking to form a holistic gaming strategy to connect with the next generation of consumers who are getting harder to reach through the typical media mix requiring expertise. Gaming and esports are growing exponentially across EMEA, and brands at the forefront of this trend will win in the attention economy.”*

Livewire has hired ex-Dentsu DGame leads Luke Aldridge and Peter Jacobs as Directors to lead the EMEA region

Aldridge and Jacobs previously created and lead the integrated gaming division DGame for global media agency Dentsu out of London, the first of its kind in the UK across the big six agency holding groups. They come with a wealth of gaming and digital marketing experience having won major clients including Kellogg’s and Mondelez, delivering successful gaming campaigns for their roster of clients across gaming strategy, in-game advertising, talent & esports.

Khabra and Manuel continued, *“we’re excited that Luke and Pete will lead our EMEA expansion. They are experienced gaming marketers who understand the importance of gaming ecosystem strategy, coupled with great content and gametech.”*

Aldridge said, *“What Indy and Brad have built in such a short space of time with Livewire is remarkable. They have a deep understanding of the entire gaming ecosystem and how to approach it as a marketer. It’s tremendously exciting to join forces with them at this stage in their journey, building on the successes they have had in APAC to deliver value and innovation to brands across EMEA.”*

Jacobs adds, “We are now seeing some of the biggest brands in the world take advantage of the many opportunities gaming presents to engage audiences in unique and immersive ways. It is a complex and fascinating world – massive audiences, unparalleled engagement, and full of sub-cultures. We’re thrilled to join Indy & Brad in helping marketers in EMEA navigate it successfully.”

Livewire launched in Australia in March 2021 and already boasts dozens of clients ranging from FMCG/CPG, entertainment, retail, sports, delivery, gaming peripherals, food & beverage and finance.

The global business expansion will continue across APAC and EMEA.

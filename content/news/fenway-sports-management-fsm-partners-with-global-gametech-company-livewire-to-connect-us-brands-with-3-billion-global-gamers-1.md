We look forward to working with this fast-growing, and innovative company and helping them bring the potential of the gaming marketplace to the U.S.”

As Livewire’s Head of Commercial for North America, newly-appointed Peter Beeney will drive its partnerships and operations, expanding Livewire’s footprint across the country. Previously Vice President Global Agency Sales at The Washington Post and Global Holding Company Lead at Spotify, Peter will take the lead on FSM’s partnership, ensuring its continued success over the course of the agreement.

Brad Manuel and Indy Khabra, Co-Founders and Co-CEOs of Livewire said that the partnership with FSM was an opportunity to directly access and introduce core brands across North America and U.S. to the influential gaming environment.

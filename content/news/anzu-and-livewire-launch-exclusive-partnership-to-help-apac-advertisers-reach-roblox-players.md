Roblox is a global metaverse where millions of players gather to create, share, and play together in immersive worlds. As of January 2022, the platform has over 40 million games covering every genre imaginable. The platform continues to gain popularity in APAC and reached a record 9.4 million daily active users in Q3 2021.


On the new partnership, Livewire Co-Founders Indy Khabra and Brad Manuel said: “We're thrilled to partner with Anzu and extremely excited to bring the Roblox platform exclusively to marketers and agencies in APAC. Livewire's vision to be the leading gaming marketing and gametech company takes another leap forward with the immersive virtual world of Roblox. The platform is also fully GDPR and COPPA compliant highlighting their dedication to kidsafe gaming. As more brands add gaming strategies to their 2022 marketing plans, Livewire is a pioneer, using technology and industry expertise to access a deep reservoir of consumers attention on global gaming platforms like Roblox.”


Currently, advertisers working with Anzu across Roblox can reach 110M+ monthly active users worldwide. Its turnkey solution allows advertisers to run display ads and gifs, at speed and scale across multiple Roblox games in minutes, many of which are exclusive to Anzu. Custom integrations are also available. Roblox titles include All Star Tower Defense, Speed Run 4, Wacky Wizards, and Weight Lifting Simulator, which collectively have amassed a staggering 4.8B visits worldwide. Advertisers working with Anzu also benefit from guaranteed viewable impressions, brand safety, detailed campaign reporting, and brand lift measurement.


Top Down Games, the studio behind Roblox hit All Star Tower Defense, one of Roblox’s most played titles, said “Anzu’s solution allows brands to become part of the game, with their ads appearing on in-game objects that naturally feel part of the gameplay. At the same time, they can reach millions of players within an environment where they are fully engaged and feel comfortable.”


Anzu Co-Founder and CEO Itamar Benedy said: “Some of the world’s biggest brands are using Roblox’s popularity and global reach to access previously hard-to-reach audiences, who are increasingly spending more time on the platform. Thanks to our exclusive partnership with Livewire, advertisers in APAC can now reach an engaged and diverse audience through our non-disruptive in-game ads that add to the gameplay, making experiences more realistic.”

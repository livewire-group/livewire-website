The world’s most advanced in-game advertising platform Anzu has expanded its exclusive partnership with leading global gametech and gaming marketing company Livewire to help more APAC advertisers reach players within some of the most popular AAA console titles via non-disruptive in-game ads.

 

Livewire creates integrated gaming marketing strategies, using their experience with gaming publishers, content creators, digital platforms, and emerging technology to design campaigns and deliver solutions that add value. The partnership with Anzu, the award-winning in-game advertising solution and the first to serve programmatic in-game ads on consoles, first began in January when the [two companies partnered to help APAC advertisers](https://www.thedrum.com/profile/anzu-io/news/anzu-partners-with-livewire-to-boost-apac-ad-reach-in-roblox) reach players in Roblox.

 

With [1.4BN gamers in APAC](https://www.statista.com/topics/2196/video-game-industry-in-asia/), expected to grow to 1.8BN by 2024, advertisers running their campaigns in premium titles have a unique opportunity to place themselves in front of this large and diverse audience. With the APAC games market also estimated to grow by over 10% annually with a [total market cap of $708.3 billion by 2026](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/asia-pacific-digital-gaming-market-outlook-by-industry-size-share-revenue-regions-and-top-key-players-analysis-2021-2030-2022-03-02?mod=search_headline#:~:text=Asia%20Pacific%20digital%20gaming%20market%20will%20grow%20by%2010.4%25%20annually,%24708.3%20billion%20over%202020%2D2026.&text=Mar%2002%2C%202022%20(Heraldkeepers),%24708.3%20billion%20over%202020%2D2026.), this lucrative region has plenty of demand up for grabs.

 

Livewire co-founders Indy Khabra and Brad Manuel said: “Launching in-game ads within premium AAA console titles is a significant milestone for gametech. Console games boast large durational play time, high attention rates, and are often played on large screens. Brands and agencies can now reach players within this premium environment via in-game ads that add to the gaming experience.”

 

Anzu is the sole official licensed provider for Xbox and their offering includes AAA console titles from leading game studios, including Ubisoft and Saber Interactive, who recently announced a partnership with Anzu to bring in-game ads into their highly anticipated AAA racer [Dakar Desert Rally](https://www.exchangewire.com/blog/2022/02/17/anzu-becomes-exclusive-in-game-ad-tech-provider-for-saber-interactives-dakar-desert-rally/) at launch. Many more AAA titles are also on the way. This adds to Livewire’s growing suite of gaming solutions including the recent launch of a Social Gaming offering and the Livewire Creative Studios.

 

Advertisers highly favor the console platform as it offers a premium environment where players are 100% immersed in the game with no second screening. Anzu’s ad placements are served as part of the gaming experience, which maximizes brand impact, making the brands shown feel like they are part of the game. [Vodafone recently saw success using Anzu’s in-game ads](https://www.audienceproject.com/blog/something-new/customer-success-story-vodafone-achieves-176-lift-in-campaign-awareness-for-in-game-ad-campaign/) in Ubisoft’s hit Trackmania, which resulted in a ​​176% lift in campaign awareness and a 20% lift in brand consideration.

 

Itamar Benedy, Co-Founder and CEO, Anzu, said: “We are very excited to bring our premium AAA console inventory to more advertisers in APAC through this extended partnership with Livewire. We have already seen huge success working together with Roblox. I’m looking forward to extending this partnership and success to the console space, which is becoming an increasingly important media channel for advertisers looking to connect with their audience in an authentic and engaging way.”

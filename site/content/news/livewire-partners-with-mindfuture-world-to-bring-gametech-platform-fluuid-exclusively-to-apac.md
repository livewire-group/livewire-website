Livewire is a gaming-focused digital marketing agency based out of Australia. The company launched earlier this year under the leadership of co-founders Indy Khabra and Brad Manuel. With this agreement, Mindfuture becomes the first streaming-focused agency to team up with the company.

 

“Our strategic partnership with Mindfuture World and their in-live streaming gametech platform Fluuid supports content creators with brands globally. Gametech is a core pillar of Livewire and we’re investing in solutions that are innovative and marketing leading.” said Brad Manuel, Co-Founder & CEO of Livewire,

 

This collaboration comes as part of a wider expansion that has seen Mindfuture World expand into a variety of new markets throughout 2020 and early 2021. This year alone, Mindfuture has launched campaigns in Japan and The Middle East, along with a scaled-up offering in the MENA region.

 

Neil Johnston, Media Trading and Partnership Director at Mindfuture World, said “Marketing to the highly valuable gamer audience is really at early stage, but is set for explosive growth. Livewire are the undoubted gaming marketing experts in the APAC region and it is exciting to partner with them through their access to the Fluuid platform for the benefit of advertisers”

 

Together, Livewire and Mindfuture World are focused on creating gametech and marketing technologies that provide brands with transparency across the gaming marketing space, allowing for agnostic decision making based on data to create better outcomes for brands and agencies working in gaming.
